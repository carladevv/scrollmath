  "about_html": "<p>Scrollmath is a personal study feed designed to take advantage of the way my brain has learned to absorb information in social-media post form. I use it to refresh and revisit core ideas in mathematics through short, scrollable excerpts.</p><p>A secondary goal is to keep concepts in context: for example, seeing Dedekind cuts not as a floating abstraction, but in Dedekind's own words, with the author's picture, the publication date, and the work where the idea is introduced. This helps me build a stronger mental map of mathematical history.</p><p>The content focus follows the first-semester curriculum of the Spanish mathematics degree at UNED (where I study). As I progress and discover useful or interesting sources, I will add more works to the feed.</p><p>AI has helped me select and format quotations from the texts I provide, but none of the mathematical content itself is generated: the posts are direct excerpts from the original sources.</p>",
